# Python Optmizer (3 dimensional)

A hill climbing algorithm in python.
<br>
How to find a global maximum or minimum.
<br><br>
p.s.: this is one of my first algorithms. I'm sorry for the bad style. I may be working on a Version 2 soon. ;D

:exclamation: This algorithm may encounter a local maximum or minimum [read about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima), and may be trapped there.

A good strategy could be run the code several times, starting from different point randomly chosen.

Example of 3 dimension topology:
